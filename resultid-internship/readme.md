## Resultid Internship

This folder contains code that I developed for my internship with Resultid.

Resultid is an AI-powered business intelligence company whose platform allows for automated market assessments of new technologies by synthesizing data from patents, grants, market data, and company information, enabling investors and market researchers to make better-informed evaluations of early-stage innovations.

From January 2021 to March 2021, I worked with Resultid as a natural language processing (NLP) intern. Over the course of my internship, I developed code that allows for automated extraction of the names of a company's competitors given the company's 10-K financial report.
